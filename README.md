# XcodeTemplate
A silly Xcode template repository idea I've had for a while.

### Problem
You want to develop for Apple platforms, but you don't want to drop the money on a new Mac.

### Solution
[XcodeTemplate](http://github.com/nythepegasus/XcodeTemplate)!

### Features
---
* A fully configurable Xcode target
  * It currently has the following platforms selected to be built:
    * iOS/iPadOS
    * tvOS
    * macOS
    * visionOS
* TBD

### TODO
* Add a watchOS (example) target
* Add Github Actions CI scripts
